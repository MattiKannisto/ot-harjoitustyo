# Requirements specification for the software DnaSequencingToolPython

## Intended use
The software allows the user to automatically generate primer pairs for sequencing reactions. The user gives the software the DNA sequence to be sequenced as text and the software generates a list of primer pairs suitable for sequencing the region of interest.

## Users
There will be only one group of users. If a need arises, more user groups will be added.

## Draft user interface
At the beginning, the software will contain at least following views:

When the user starts the software, a login view will be displayed. If the user has not created an account he/she can do it by clicking 'Add new account' button. A view will then be displayed where username and password will be requested from the user. If the given username and password meet the requirements defined below, a new user will be created and login view will be displayed again. Otherwise, the account creation view will be continued to be displayed and the user will be instructed to add valid username and/or password. A user who has already created an account can log in, after which a view will be displayed where new DNA sequences can be added, existing DNA sequences can be selected, and primers can be generated for the selected DNA sequence. In the 'Options' menu, the user can choose to change primer settings, which determine how primers are generated by the software.

## Basic functionalities
### If the user has not logged in to the system
- The user can create a new user account
  - The username needs to be unique and needs to be at least 5 characters long
  - The password needs to be at least 10 characters long and at maximum 30 characters long
- The user can log in if he/she has already created a user account

### If the user has logged in to the system
- The user can add new DNA sequences
  - A DNA sequence needs to contain a name and a string of characters
    - Only characters 'A', 'T', 'G' and 'C' are allowed. If the DNA sequence contains other characters, it will not be added
  - The DNA sequences will be stored in an SQL database
- The user can browse his/her DNA sequences
- The user can export the DNA sequence in FASTA format
- The user can generate a list of primers for a selected DNA sequence
  - The primers generated will contain an automatically generated name and a sequence corresponding to the region it anneals to in the DNA sequence
  - The primers will be added to the SQL database and mapped to the DNA sequence they are used to sequence
- The user can export primers generated for the DNA sequence in spreadsheet format
  - The spreadsheet will be formatted so that the user can copy paste the primer list into ordering sheet of primer synthesis company
- The user can log out from the system

## Advanced functionalities
Once all basic functionalities have been implemented with sufficient quality, following advanced functionalities will be implemented
- Logged in user can adjust the parameters used by the software in detection of suitable primer annealing sites
- Logged in user can visualize the DNA sequence and see where the generated primer pairs would bind
- Logged in user can add annotations to the DNA sequences to indicate different gene experssion control elements, protein coding sequences, *etc*.
- Logged in user can download DNA sequences from [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) by giving its identifier
