# Requirements specification for the software DnaSequencingToolPython

## Intended use
The software allows the user to automatically generate primers for sequencing reactions and to translate the DNA sequences into protein sequences. The user gives the software the DNA fragment to be sequenced as text and the software generates a list of primer pairs suitable for sequencing the region of interest.

## Users
There will be only one group of users. Although DnaSequencingToolPython is a desktop application, primers might be designed on shared computers in laboratories, and thus it is necessary to have the user account functionality.

## Draft user interface
At the beginning, the software will contain at least following views:

When the user starts the software, a login view will be displayed. If the user has not created an account he/she can do it by clicking 'Create user account' button. A view will then be displayed where username, password and an output file directory will be requested from the user. If the given username and password meet the requirements defined below, a new user will be created and login view will be displayed again. Otherwise, the account creation view will be continued to be displayed and the user will be instructed to add valid username and/or password. A user who has already created an account can log in, after which a view will be displayed where new DNA sequences can be added, existing DNA sequences can be selected, and primers can be generated for the selected DNA sequence. The DNA sequence can also be translated into corresponding protein sequence. In the 'Options' menu, the user can choose to change primer settings, which determine how primers are generated by the software, and account settings.

## Basic functionalities

### Help and instructions
- The user will get notified if he/she tries to enter invalid information (**DONE**)
- The user will get notified of the successfulness of different DNA fragment analysis actions (**DONE**)
- The user will get instructions on the use of the application if he/she clicks 'Help' in the application (**DONE**)

### If the user has not logged in to the system
- The user can create a new user account (**DONE**)
  - The username needs to be unique and needs to be at least 5 characters long (**DONE**)
  - The password needs to be at least 10 characters long and at maximum 30 characters long (**DONE**)
  - The working directory where output files will be saved needs to be specified (**DONE**)
    - The working directory cannot be already in use by another user (**DONE**)
    - The user needs to have rights to write files into the working directory (**DONE**)
- The user can log in if he/she has already created a user account (**DONE**)

### If the user has logged in to the system
- The user can add new DNA sequences (**DONE**)
  - A DNA sequence needs to contain a name and a string of characters (**DONE**)
    - Only characters 'A', 'T', 'G' and 'C' are allowed. If the DNA sequence contains other characters, it will not be added (**DONE**)
  - The DNA sequences will be stored in an SQL database (**DONE**)
- The user can browse his/her DNA sequences (**DONE**)
- The user can translate his/her DNA sequences into protein sequences (**DONE**)
  - The protein sequences will be saved to a CSV file (**DONE**)
- Logged in user can adjust the parameters used by the software in detection of suitable primer annealing sites (**DONE**)
- The user can generate a list of primers for a selected DNA sequence (**DONE**)
  - The primers generated will contain an automatically generated name and a sequence corresponding to the region it anneals to in the DNA sequence (**DONE**)
  - The primers will be added to the SQL database and mapped to the DNA sequence they are used to sequence (**DONE**)
- The user can export primers generated for the DNA sequence in spreadsheet format (**DONE**)
  - The spreadsheet will be formatted so that the user can copy paste the primer list into ordering sheet of primer synthesis company (**DONE**)
- The user can log out from the system (**DONE**)
- The user can delete his/her account (**DONE**)

## Advanced functionalities
Following advanced functionalities could be implemented if the application will be further developed:
- Logged in user can visualize the DNA sequence and see where the generated primer pairs would bind
- Logged in user can add annotations to the DNA sequences to indicate different gene experssion control elements, protein coding sequences, *etc*.
- Logged in user can download DNA sequences from [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) by giving its identifier
